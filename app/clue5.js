// Having found everything else we now need to figure out the location of Carmen's hideout

// Before we go to the location, We need a criminal description to provide to the local authorities which includes the following information (add these to the carmen object below): 
// name (Carmen SanDiego)
// heightInInches, (67) 
// captured, (false) 
// outfit (red hat, red coat, yellow scarf, black boots) 
// The name property should have a value that is a string, the height property 
// heightInInches should have a value that is a number, the captured property should have a 
// boolean value, and the outfit property should have a value that is an 
// array. Inside the array, include at least 4 string values.

var carmen = {
  // TODO YOUR CODE HERE
  name: 'Carmen SanDiego',
  heightInInches: 67,
  captured: false,
  outfit: ['red hat', 'red coat', 'yellow scarf', 'black boots']
}

// So the warrent gets updated as quickly as possible our database needs to quickly check if she has been captured

// write a function that returns the value of the captured property on your carmen object using dot notation.
function isCaptured() {
  // TODO YOUR CODE HERE
  return carmen.captured;
}

// Now that that is settled lets, figure out where we are going from this plane ticket stub we found where some information has been scrambled

var ticket = {
  id: "59ee052546081123d0e21843",
  airline: "aim care",
  flightNumber: 317,
  firstClass: false
}

// Write a function that uses bracket notation to change one of the the ticket's keys to the new value
function updateValue(key, newValue) {
  // TODO YOUR CODE HERE
  ticket[key] = newValue;
  // return ticket;
}

// Create a function that uses dot or bracket notation to create a property 
// on the ticket object called 'status' and assign it the parameter that is passed. 

function flightStatus(status) {
  // TODO YOUR CODE HERE
  ticket.status = status;
  return ticket;
}


// The ticket id is messing with our internal systems id's write a function that will delete the id property off of the ticket object (DO NOT EDIT THE PRE-WRITTEN CODE)
function removeId() {
  // TODO YOUR CODE HERE
  delete ticket.id;
  return ticket;
}
